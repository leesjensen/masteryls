  "title": "Advanced Web Framework Programming",
  "description": "This course gives an advanced survey of the common web frameworks such as  React, Vue, and Svelte. We then dive into the implementation details of each framework. This includes how each framework implements DOM interactions, managing state, handling reactivity, routing, and integrating HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The different framework approaches are compared and contrasted with discussions of performance, scalability, and developer experience. You then create your own web framework that renders components, manages state, supports reactivity, handles routing, and integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a demonstration of your mastery you build a modern web application using your framework.",
