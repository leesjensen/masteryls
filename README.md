## Functionality

### Configuration

create your `config.js` file in the root of the project.

```js
export default {
  supabase: {
    url: 'https://yyy.supabase.co',
    key: 'xxx',
  },
};
```

### Course

A course definition is read from the `course.json` file found in the root of the repo. If there is not `course.json` file then the content of the `instruction/modules.md` file is analyzed to try and discover the course.

#### Example `course.json`

```json
{
  "title": "QA & DevOps",
  "schedule": "schedule/schedule.md",
  "syllabus": "instruction/syllabus/syllabus.md",
  "links": {
    "canvas": "https://byu.instructure.com/courses/31151",
    "chat": "https://discord.com/channels/748656649287368704"
  },
  "modules": [
    {
      "title": "Course info",
      "topics": [
        { "title": "Home", "path": "README.md" },
        { "title": "Syllabus", "path": "instruction/syllabus/syllabus.md" },
        { "title": "Schedule", "path": "schedule/schedule.md" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### GitHub repo structure

In order for a GitHub repo to function as the source for a Mastery LS course it must have the following structure.

```txt
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── instruction
│   ├── modules.md
│   ├── topic1
│   │   └── topic1.md
│   ├── topic2
│   │   ├── topic2.md
│   │   └── topic2.gif
│   ├── topic3
│   │   ├── topic3.md
│   │   └── topic3.png
│   └── template
│       └── template.md
├── syllabus
│   └── syllabus.md
└── schedule
    └── schedule.md
```

#### Modules

The `modules.md` file creates the content structure for the course. It uses the headings levels to generate the interface for the instruction modules. The modules file allows you to reorganize the topic order in any desired structure. When Mastery LS loads a course it first parses `modules.md` to generate the table of contents. If a course author modifies the order of topics, and commits the change, then the `modules.md` file is overwritten.

You should only manually modify the contents of `modules.md` if you understand the structure of the file. Any additions to the file beyond the recognized structure will be lost when the file is altered by Mastery LS.

```md
# Instructional modules

## Module1 title

- [Topic1](topic1/topic1.md)
- [Topic2](topic2/topic2.md)

## Module2 title

- [Topic3](topic3/topic3.md)
- [Topic4](topic4/topic4.md)
```

## Development notes

I want to keep this really simple and so I am going to use:

1. Vite
1. Basic React library
1. Tailwind CSS
1. Supabase for database and authentication

This should make it so that I can host the whole thing as a static website and just host it on GitHub.

### Markdown support

There are lots of markdown libraries out there such as `marked`, `react-markdown`, and `remark`. I went with react markdown and various remark plugins.

### Added Tailwind for style

Followed these basic [instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) for using with Vite.
