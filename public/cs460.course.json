  "title": "Advanced Web Framework Programmingx",
  "description": "This course gives an advanced survey of the common web frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte. We then dive into the implementation details of each framework. This includes how each framework implements DOM interactions, manages state, handles reactivity, routing, and integrating HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Different framework approaches are compared and contrasted with discussions of performance, scalability, and developer productivity. You then create your own web framework that renders components, manages state, enables reactivity, handles routing, and integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the duration of the course you demonstrate your mastery by defining and creating a modern web application using the framework you have created.",
